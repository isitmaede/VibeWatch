## Personalized Movie Recommendations Based on Your Mood

VibeWatch is a mobile application built with React Native that provides movie recommendations tailored to your current mood. Simply describe how you're feeling, and our AI-powered system, integrated with OMDb, will suggest a movie that fits your vibe, complete with details and a plot summary in your preferred language.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Mood-Based Recommendations:** Get unique movie suggestions by describing your current mood (e.g., "happy and energetic," "sad and reflective," "adventurous").
* **Multi-Language Support:** The app intelligently detects the language of your mood input and provides the movie plot translation in that language (for Arabic, English, etc.).
* **Rich Movie Details:** Fetches comprehensive movie information including title, IMDb rating, and poster from the OMDb API.
